- Theme Switching: Offer light and dark theme options to cater to different user preferences and viewing conditions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant magenta (#FF00FF) to reflect the 'Neon Magenta' provided as branding for call to actions, highlights and important data points.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#0A0A0A). A dark theme sets the stage for a modern, tech-focused feel, contrasting well with the bright accent colors, making data visualization pop. A lower value was picked to be slightly darker than the proposed color.
- Accent color: Electric cyan (#00FFFF), mirroring 'Neon Cyan,' for interactive elements.
- Inter (400, 600) for readability.
- Grid-based layout for responsiveness.
- Subtle animations on hover for user feedback.
